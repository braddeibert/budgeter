# Budgeter
Semester project for CSCI 291 (Web Applications Development) at the University of Montana, Fall 2020

Budgeter is a web application built on the web framework Django, which helps users manage their finances by allowing them to create budgets, track expenses and income, and set goals for saving. Users will sign-in to their own accounts in order to access saved budgets and other information.

Budgets are nameable and fully customizable, allowing users to add and categorize their expected expenses by name and amount. This flexibility allows the user to create a budget for any purpose they choose (such as monthly expenses, a grocery trip budget, or Christmas shopping budget). The user will be able to enter their actual purchases into the app, to track how well they are doing on their budget.
