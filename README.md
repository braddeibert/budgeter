# Budgeter
Semester project for CSCI 291 (Web Applications Development) at the University of Montana, Fall 2020

Budgeter will be a Django web application that helps users manage their finances by allowing them to create budgets, track expenses and income, and set goals for saving. Users will sign-in to their own accounts in order to access saved budgets and other information.

Budgets will be nameable and fully customizable, allowing users to add and categorize their expected expenses by name and amount. This flexibility allows the user to create a budget for any purpose they choose (such as monthly expenses, a grocery trip budget, or Christmas shopping budget). The user will be able to enter and track their actual expenses with the app, to see how well they are doing on their budget. 

For those interested in saving money, the app will allow users to add income information to their account. With this information, the app will calculate how much take-home money the user can expect if they follow their budget.
